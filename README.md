# Zoo Management System

A management system of this type can be
used by businesses to keep track of the
amount of animals their zoos have, the
amount of enclosures, workers, and so on. It
also enables easy addition and removal of
data, like animals, easy listing of useful data,
like the animals and what enclosures theyâ€™re
in, and easy searching, to see details about a
particular animal. All of this can be served on
a privilege basis, i.e., not everyone who uses
the system may be allowed to do the same
operation.
